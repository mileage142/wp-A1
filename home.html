      Geoff is a sheep, cattle and wheat farmer from north-western NSW.  In addition to this he produces beautifull woodfired pottery, primarily in his japanese-style anagama tunnel kiln.<br><br>

      While Geoff primarily makes pots as a hobby he is very well respected in the woodfiring community and has held a number of very successfull exhibitions.  Previously it has only been possible to purchase his work at galleries for a substantial markup, but with this website we are offering you a chance to purchase unique handmade and woodfired pieces for your home
